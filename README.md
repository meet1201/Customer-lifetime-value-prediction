# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for users of an online retail platform. CLV is a critical metric in understanding how valuable a customer is to a business across the entirety of their relationship. It helps businesses tailor marketing efforts, predict revenue, and develop customer retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Online Retail" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail. The data is primarily an invoice of transactions, with each row representing an invoice line item.

## Data Features

- **InvoiceNo:** Invoice number (a unique identifier for each transaction)
- **StockCode:** Product code
- **Description:** Product description
- **Quantity:** The quantities of each product per transaction
- **InvoiceDate:** Invoice date and time
- **UnitPrice:** Price per unit
- **CustomerID:** Customer number (a unique identifier for each customer)
- **Country:** Country name (where the customer lives)

## Source

The dataset can be accessed directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at the following URL: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx).

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and other preprocessing tasks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to find patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from the existing data to improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Building:** Developing a machine learning model to predict the Customer Lifetime Value.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
